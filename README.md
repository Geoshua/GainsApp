# About
The project is built using Firebase backend and plain Javascript/HTML/CSS.

It is intended to be a gym and nutrition tracker web application.
Currently, the project implements a user authentication system with firebase, a nutrient logger system, a workout tracker, a simple history section with the logs.
# Notes
The prototype for this app can be accessed at https://geoshua.github.io/gainsapp/public/main.html
The application will be reworked using ReactJS and hence this project will no longer be worked on, please find the ReactJS rework at https://github.com/Geoshua/GainsApp-React.
